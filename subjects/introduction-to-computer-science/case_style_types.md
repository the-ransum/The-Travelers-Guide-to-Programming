# Case Style Types

As programmers, chances are on the daily you come across scenarios where you have to follow certain naming conventions. It is considered good practice to know which case style type to use for which kinds of scenarios.

When it comes to programming, a case style is the act of combining two or more words into a single string, and there are a handful of methods.

The top most commonly used styles include:
- [What is Camel Case?](#what-is-camel-case)
- [What is Snake Case?](#what-is-snake-case)
- [What is Kebab Case?](#what-is-kebab-case)
- [What is Pascal Case?](#what-is-pascal-case)

## What is Camel Case?

In camel case, you start a name with a small letter. If the name has multiple words, the later words will start with a capital letter:

An example of camel case: `firstName` and `lastName`.

## What is Snake Case?

Like in camel case, you start the name with a small letter in snake case. If the name has multiple words, the later words will start with small letters and you use a underscore (\_) to separate the words.

An example of snake case: `first_name` and `last_name`.

## What is Kebab Case?

Kebab case is similar to snake case, but you use a hyphen (-) instead of an underscore (\_) to separate the words.

An example of kebab case: `first-name` and `last-name`.

## What is Pascal Case?

Unlike the previous examples, names in pascal case start with a capital letter. In case of the names with multiple words, all words will start with capital letters.

An example of pascal case: `FirstName` and `LastName`.
